Installing the requirements tool:

After running the build process (see BUILD), type

sudo make install

Usually this will install:

/usr/local/bin/req
/usr/local/bin/qreq
/usr/local/lib/requirements.so
/usr/local/include/requirements/

Please run

sudo ldconfig

before executing either req or qreq, this will ensure the libraries are found.
