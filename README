Simple and fast requirement analysis tool. (In development)

This tool was written for small software businesses with the need to
collect requirements and related topics quickly.

It can be used for:
 * Editing requirements, acceptance criteria, cost estimates.
 * Printing several documents required during the development phase.
 * Automatic analysis of coverage, e.g. if functional requirements are
   covered by acceptance criteria.
 * Automatic collection of test results and integrating them
   into reports.

There is a console tool and a graphical tool available. Each suited
for different phases of the project.

The content is stored as plain text files, therefore can be managed by
all kinds of source code version control systems (e.g. git, svn).
