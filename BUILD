Building the requirements tools:

You need:

 cmake, at least version 3
 g++, at least version 4.9 (aquivalent clang may also work)
 libxml
 libgtkmm-3.0-dev (for the graphical tool)
 googletest (very recent version, best is from source)

Once all this is available, in the projects root folder type:

 mkdir -p build
 cd build
 cmake ..
 make

You can also limit building to certain targets:

 make req     Only build console requirement tool
 make greq    Only build graphical requirement tool
 make t       Only build tests

All three are based on the requirements library, librequirements.
